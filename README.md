An interactive BMO like interface to launch game emulators

## Design Goal

The goal of this project is to make an interface that matches the character design from [Adventure Time](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/BMO)

As such, the menu UX will most likely resemble a TI calculator or something similar, but with different colors and font.

## Compiling

This repo uses gradle, so you can simply clone the repo and compile using gradle

```
./gradlew build
```

## Kotlin Requirement

This project uses [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), so you should use a compatable IDE (I recommend [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)), however there is an [Eclipse plugin for Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse).
